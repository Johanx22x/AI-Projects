# Face Detection Models

There is a basic implementation 
of various face detection models, 
using deep learning frameworks and 
basic libraries.

## Models Included

1. `Haar Cascade Classifier`: Classic face detection algorithm based on Haar-like features and cascade classifiers.

2. `Dlib`: Dlib library provides pre-trained models and algorithms for face detection, including the Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) method and the deep learning-based CNN method.

3. `MTCNN` (Multi-Task Cascaded Convolutional Networks): A deep learning-based face detection model that detects faces and facial landmarks simultaneously.

4. `RetinaFace`: A state-of-the-art face detection model based on deep learning, known for its accuracy in detecting faces with various poses, scales, and occlusions.

5. `SSD` (Single Shot MultiBox Detector): A versatile object detection algorithm that can also be used for face detection. It offers real-time performance and accurate face localization.

6. `YuNet`: A lightweight and efficient face detection model specifically designed for resource-constrained devices. It achieves a good balance between accuracy and speed, making it suitable for embedded systems and mobile applications.

7. `Mediapipe`: A cross-platform framework developed by Google that provides various pre-trained models and pipelines for real-time face detection, tracking, and facial landmark estimation.

8. `YOLO` (You Only Look Once): An efficient object detection algorithm that can be used for face detection. It offers real-time performance and accurate bounding box predictions.

9. `DSFD` (Dual Shot Face Detector): An advanced face detection algorithm that combines single-shot and two-shot strategies for highly accurate and efficient face detection, particularly effective in detecting faces with various poses, scales, and occlusions.
